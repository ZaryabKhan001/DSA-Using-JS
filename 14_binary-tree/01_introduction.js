//? Introduction to Trees?

//? Tree:
// Non-linear structure.
// Hierarchical in nature.
// Node:
// Can have zero or more children.
// Has only one parent (except root).
// Cannot have cycles: Mean node have only one parent, otherwise it will form cycle (graphs).
// Exactly one path exists between any two nodes.
// No two parents can share the same child.

//? Why Tree Data Structures?
// Not every type of data can be stored in an array or linked list.
// When we need to store hierarchical data, we use trees.

//? Examples:
// File Systems
// HTML DOM
// Databases
// Hierarchical Data Models

//? Types of Trees:
// General Tree: Any number of children.
// Binary Tree: At most two children per node.
// Binary Search Tree (BST): left < root < right.
// Complete Binary Tree: All levels filled except possibly the last.
// Full Binary Tree: Each node has 0 or 2 children.
// Perfect Binary Tree: Full and all leaves are at the same level.
// Balanced Binary Tree: Height is log(n).

//? Visualization:

//? Tree Terminology:
// Node
// Parent
// Child
// Sibling
// Height
// Sub-tree

//? Tree Representation:
// Using Nodes & Pointers:

//? Tree Visualisation
// root.val = 1;
// root.left = 2;
// root.right = 3;
